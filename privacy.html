						<h2>Why We Need To Consume Healthy Smoothies: The 15 Reasons</h2>
                    <p class="header-p">On a regualr basis, why do so many people consume healthy smoothies? Many of the reasons below are associated with a particular health benefit, several others made the list. Developing the habit of making healthy smoothies on a daily basis is an excellent investment of your time, that would be something you will learn upon reading this article or blog.</p>

<br>
<br><img src="img/smoothies.jpg"><br><font size=1>*Disclaimer</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>1.	<b>Healthy eating education.</b> By learning what constitutes a healthy smoothie, you'll also educate yourself on what comprises a healthy food lifestyle. This will allow you to make better decisions when the blender isn't around. You'll be more confident in your food choices.
<br>
<br>2.	<b>Strengthen your immune system.</b> Getting sick is no fun. Reduce the number of times you get sick (if at all) and lesson the severity by empowering your immune system.
<br>
<br>3.	<b>Deeper sleep.</b> Improving your health by consuming healthy smoothies almost always results in better sleep at night.
<br>
<br>4. <b>Energy.</b> Supply your body with the right fuel for more energy in the short and long term.
<br>
<br>5. <b>Reduce cravings.</b> We all crave sweets and unhealthy foods from time to time. Reduce those cravings, or better yet, replace what you would normally splurge on with a healthy alternative.
<br><img src="img/smoothies2.jpg"><br><font size=1>*Disclaimer</font>
<br>6.	<b>Get your daily allowance of fruits and vegetables.</b> Consuming the daily recommendations of fruits and vegetables can be a challenge. Blending a couple of servings of each into a smoothie helps ensure you meet your body's daily nutritional needs.
<br>
<br>7.	<b>Quick and easy.</b> Making your own nutrient dense smoothie doesn't take as long as preparing most meals, giving you more time for others things. Taking a smoothie with you is an additional convenient option.
<br><img src="img/smoothies3.jpg"><br><font size=1>*Disclaimer</font>
<br>8.	<b>Easier body mass loss.</b> There are a number of body mass loss programs that promote replacing a meal with a liquid drink. Provide your body with all the vitamins and minerals it needs via smoothies, cut out the body mass gaining crap from your food lifestyle, and watch the pounds melt away. Lose body mass easier than before and slim down the healthy way with food lifestyle smoothies.
<br>
<br>9.	<b>Beauty.</b> Think radiant skin, hair, and nails. Supply your body with the vitamins and minerals it requires to grow healthier hair and make your skin glow.
<br>
<br>10. <b>Brain boost.</b> Give your brain all the vitamins and nutrients it needs to improve your mental clarity, focus, and memory. Say goodbye to brain fog.
<br>
<br>11. <b>Happiness.</b> Experience a renewed sense of calm and well-being that good health leads to. Be in a good mood all the time.
<br>
<br>12.	<b>Improved digestion.</b> Nobody I know wants to experience constipation or indigestion. Let your blender "chew" your food and ease the burden on your digestive system while you simultaneously consume plenty of food lifestyleary fiber to ensure excellent digestion.
<br><img src="img/smoothies4.jpg"><br><font size=1>*Disclaimer</font>
<br>13.	<b>Detox.</b> We're exposed to and bombarded by thousands of man-made chemicals in today's world, which leaves our body begging to detoxify. Give your digestive system a break while adding detoxifying ingredients like dandelion greens and kale into your smoothies to aid your body's detoxification processes.
<br>
<br>14.	<b>Build muscle and improve athletic performance.</b> Provide your body with the nutrients it needs to excel during athletic competition, and recover and rebuild after working out. It's easier for your body to absorb and assimilate the nutrients in a smoothie as opposed to a meal.
<br>
<br>15. <b>Fun!</b> Many people including myself find creating smoothies to be rather enjoyable. You can think of yourself as a modern day alchemist mixing and matching various smoothie ingredients.
<br>
<br>As you are now aware, routinely consuming healthy smoothies is beneficial for a number of reasons. This habit has personally helped me tremendously on my own journey to better health. What benefits have you experienced from healthy smoothie consumption?
<br>
<br>This list is not exhaustive. If there are any reasons you consume smoothies that aren't included above, I'd love to hear them in the comments below.
